## üîÑ END-TO-END DATA FLOW

### **Expected Flow:**
```
1. P-Gateway Simulator
   ‚Üì (generates simulated traffic)
   ‚Üì publishes to Kafka topic: network-traffic
   ‚Üì
2. Kafka Topic: network-traffic
   ‚Üì (streams traffic events)
   ‚Üì
3. Kafka Subscriber Service
   ‚Üì (consumes traffic events)
   ‚Üì (enriches with session data from Redis)
   ‚Üì publishes to Kafka topic: policy-decisions
   ‚Üì
4. Policy Enforcer Service
   ‚Üì (consumes policy-decisions)
   ‚Üì (fetches policies from DynamoDB: pc-prod-parental-policies)
   ‚Üì (checks against application registry)
   ‚Üì (applies blocking rules)
   ‚Üì (stores metrics in Redis & DynamoDB)
   ‚Üì publishes to Kafka topic: blocked-requests (if blocked)
   ‚Üì
5. FTD Integration Service
   ‚Üì (consumes blocked-requests)
   ‚Üì (creates firewall rules on FTDv)
   ‚Üì (updates ftd-rule-mapping in DynamoDB)
   ‚Üì
6. Analytics Dashboard Service
   ‚Üì (serves REST APIs)
   ‚Üì (queries enforcement-history from DynamoDB)
   ‚Üì (queries blocked-request-metrics)
   ‚Üì (provides session lookup via Redis)
```

### **Current Status:**

- ‚úÖ All ECS services created and starting tasks
- üîÑ Tasks just started (last 5 minutes)
- üîÑ Health checks pending (containers warming up)
- ‚è≥ CloudWatch log groups not yet created (will auto-create on first log)
- ‚è≥ Kafka topics not yet created (auto-created on first publish)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MISSING COMPONENTS

### FTDv Firewall VM
- **Status:** NOT DEPLOYED ‚ùå
- **Required for:** Complete enforcement flow
- **Action:** Need to deploy FTDv EC2 instance
- **Scripts Available:**
  - `start-ftd-vm.sh` - Start FTDv instance
  - `stop-ftd-vm.sh` - Stop FTDv instance

**Deployment Steps:**
1. Launch FTDv instance (c5.xlarge) in VPC
2. Attach to pc-prod-ftd-security-group
3. Configure management IP (Elastic IP)
4. Initial FTDv setup (admin/Admin123!)
5. Configure FTD Integration Service to connect

## üß™ TESTING CHECKLIST

### Phase 1: Service Health (In Progress)
- [ ] Wait for all tasks to pass health checks (~2-3 minutes)
- [ ] Verify CloudWatch log groups created
- [ ] Check for startup errors in logs
- [ ] Verify Kafka topic auto-creation

### Phase 2: Component Connectivity
- [ ] P-Gateway can connect to MSK Kafka
- [ ] Kafka Subscriber can consume from Kafka
- [ ] Services can connect to Redis
- [ ] Services can query DynamoDB tables
- [ ] FTD Integration can reach FTDv (after FTDv deployment)

### Phase 3: Data Flow Validation
- [ ] P-Gateway generating simulated traffic
- [ ] Traffic events appearing in Kafka
- [ ] Kafka Subscriber processing events
- [ ] Policy Enforcer applying policies
- [ ] Blocked requests being logged
- [ ] Analytics Dashboard APIs responding
- [ ] FTD rules being created (after FTDv deployment)

### Phase 4: End-to-End Flow
- [ ] Simulate blocked website access
- [ ] Verify policy lookup from DynamoDB
- [ ] Verify blocking decision made
- [ ] Verify metrics stored in Redis
- [ ] Verify enforcement history in DynamoDB
- [ ] Verify FTD rule created on firewall
- [ ] Verify analytics API shows blocked request

## üîß NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

### Immediate (0-5 minutes)
1. ‚úÖ Wait for ECS tasks to pass health checks
2. ‚úÖ Verify CloudFormation stack completes (background monitor running)
3. ‚úÖ Check CloudWatch logs once available

### Short-term (5-30 minutes)
4. Deploy FTDv EC2 instance
5. Configure FTDv initial setup
6. Update FTD Integration Service with FTDv endpoint
7. Test service connectivity (health checks)
8. Verify Kafka topics created

### Medium-term (30-60 minutes)
9. Test P-Gateway traffic generation
10. Verify Kafka message flow
11. Test policy enforcement logic
12. Verify data persistence to DynamoDB
13. Test Analytics Dashboard APIs

### Testing & Validation
14. End-to-end flow test with sample policies
15. Verify FTD rule creation
16. Performance testing
17. Monitoring & alerting setup
18. Documentation updates

## üìà MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY

### CloudWatch Log Groups
**Expected (not yet created):**
- /aws/ecs/pc-prod-p-gateway
- /aws/ecs/pc-prod-kafka-subscriber
- /aws/ecs/pc-prod-policy-enforcer
- /aws/ecs/pc-prod-ftd-integration
- /aws/ecs/pc-prod-analytics-dashboard

**Auto-created on first application log output**

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- ECS task CPU/memory utilization
- MSK Kafka consumer lag
- Redis cache hit rate
- DynamoDB read/write capacity
- API response times (Analytics Dashboard)
- FTD rule creation success rate

### Health Check Endpoints
- Analytics Dashboard: `http://<private-ip>:5000/health`
- All services use container health checks

## üí∞ COST ESTIMATE (Monthly)

| Component | Configuration | Cost (USD/month) |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| MSK Kafka | 3x kafka.m5.large, 300GB | $550 |
| ECS Fargate | 5 services, 0.5vCPU, 1GB each | $110 |
| ElastiCache Redis | 2x cache.t3.micro | $30 |
| FTDv EC2 | 1x c5.xlarge (when running) | $150 |
| NAT Gateways | 3x NAT Gateways | $100 |
| DynamoDB | On-demand, 5 tables | $20 |
| Data Transfer | Intra-AZ + Internet | $50 |
| CloudWatch | Logs + Metrics | $20 |
| Other | SQS, Lambda, etc. | $20 |
| **TOTAL** | | **~$1,050/month** |

**Cost Optimization:**
- Stop FTDv when not in use: Saves ~$150/month
- Use Reserved Instances for predictable workloads
- Optimize DynamoDB with provisioned capacity
